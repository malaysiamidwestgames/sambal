            We offer delicious range in Vegetarian, Non Vegetarian and Vegan food. We promise to serve you taste that you never forget. In the ancient and bustling cities of India, some of the best food is made on the streets. Roadside tandoors, or clay ovens, turn out fresh, traditional meals and provide a common meeting place for neighborhood families to gather, socialize and eat. 
            <br/>
            Following that tradition, Taste Of India restaurant also offers flavorful, authentic East Indian cooking in a casual, family-friendly environment. Dedicated to serving the freshest food, the Taste Of India chefs make many of their ingredients—from yogurt to fresh paneer—in house, and cook every meal to order: mild, medium or hot. Since taken over in 2011, Taste Of India has offers a vast menu of chicken, lamb, goat, seafood, vegetarian and vegan dishes, as well as a selection of sweets and desserts all prepared from authentic Indian recipes. 
            <br/>

Come to Taste Of India today and experience the real thing: memorable food and exceptional value.
