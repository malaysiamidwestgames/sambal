				1.1. Players are expected to be present at the courts 10 minutes before their match starts; failure to do so may result in a forfeit from the competition
				<br>

		2.1. A match is played to the best of five games.
		<br>
		2.2. The winner of a rally scores 1 point and serves to begin the next rally.
		<br>
		2.3. Each game is played to 11 points, except that if the score reaches 10-all, the game shall continue until one player leads by 2 points.
		<br>
		
				<br><b>3. Warm-up</b><br>              
	
		3.1. Before the start of a match, the two players are allowed up to 5 minutes to “warm-up” themselves and the ball on the match court.
		<br>
		3.2. When a ball has been changed during a match, or if the match has been resumed after some delay, the players warm-up the ball to playing condition. Either player may warm up the ball during any interval in the match.
		<br>
	
				<br><b>4. Service</b>           
				<br>
				4.1. Play commences with a service.
				<br>
				4.2. The player to serve first is decided by the spin of a racket or the toss of a coin. Thereafter, the server continues serving until losing a rally, when the opponent becomes the server and the server becomes the receiver.
				<br>
				4.3. The player who wins the preceding game serves first in the next game.
				<br>
				4.4. At the beginning of each game and when the service changes from one player to the other, the server can serve from either service box.
			<br>
			4.5. After winning a rally, the server then continues serving from the alternate box.
			<br>
			4.6. To serve, a player stands with at least part of one foot on the floor within the 
			service box.
			<br>
			4.7. For a service to be good, it must be served directly onto the front wall above the 
			service line and below the out line so that on its return, unless volleyed, it reaches 
			the floor within the back quarter of the court opposite to the server’s box.
			<br>
	
		<br><b>5. Good return</b><br>              

			5.1. A return is good if the ball, before it has bounced twice on the floor, is returned correctly by the striker onto the front wall above the tin and below the out line, without first touching the floor.
			<br>
			5.2. The ball may hit the sidewalls and or the back wall before reaching the front wall.
			<br>
			5.3. A return is not good if it is “Not Up” (ball struck after bouncing more than once on the floor, or not struck correctly, or a double hit), “Down” (the ball after being struck, hits the floor before the front wall or hits the tin)or “Out” (the ball hits a wall on or above the out line).
			<br>
		<br><b>6. Rallies</b><br>              
		
			6.1. After a good service has been delivered, the players hit the ball in turn until one fails to make a good return.
			<br>
			6.2. A rally consists of a service and a number of good returns.
			<br>
			6.3. A player wins a rally if the opponent fails to make a good service or return of the ball or if, before the player has attempted to hit the ball, it touches the opponent (including racket or clothing) when the opponent is the non-striker.
			<br>
	
		<br><b>7. Hitting an opponent with the ball</b><br>              
			
			7.1. If a player strikes the ball, which, before reaching the front wall, hits the opponent, or the opponent’s racket or clothing, play stops.
			<br>
			7.2. If the return would have been good and the ball would have struck the front wall without first touching any other wall, the striker wins the rally, provided the striker did not “turn”.
			<br>
			7.3. If the ball either had struck, or would have struck, any other wall and the return would have been good, a let is played. If the return would not have been good, the striker loses the rally.
		<br>
	
		<br><b>8. Turning</b><br>              
			8.1. If the striker has either followed the ball round, or allowed it to pass around him or her (in either case striking the ball to the right of the body after the ball had passed to the left, or vice-versa) then the striker has “Turned”.
			<br>
			8.2. If the opponent is struck by the ball after the striker has turned, the rally is awarded to the opponent.
			<br>
			8.3. If the striker, while turning, stops play for fear of striking the opponent, then a let is played.
			<br>
			8.4. This is the recommended course of action in situations where a player wants to turn but is unsure of the opponent’s position.
			<br>
		<br><b>9. Further attempts</b><br>              
		
			9.1. A player, after attempting to strike the ball and missing, may make a further attempt to return the ball. If a further attempt would have resulted in a good return, but the ball hits the opponent, a let is played.
			<br>
			9.2. If the return would not have been good, the striker loses the rally.
			<br>
	
		<br><b>10. Interference</b><br>              

			10.1. When it is his or her turn to play the ball, a player is entitled to freedom from interference by the opponent.
			<br>
			10.2. To avoid interference, the opponent must try to provide the player with unobstructed direct access to the ball, a fair view of the ball, space to complete a swing at the ball and freedom to play the ball directly to any part of the front wall.
			<br>
			10.3. A player, finding the opponent interfering with the play, can accept the interference and play on, or stop play. It is preferable to stop play if there is a 
			possibility of colliding with the opponent, or of hitting him or her with racket or ball.
			<br>
			10.4. When play has stopped as a result of interference the general guidelines are:
			<br>
			10.4.1. The player is entitled to a let if he or she could have returned the ball and the opponent has made every effort to avoid the interference.
			<br>
			10.4.2. The player is not entitled to a let (i.e. loses the rally) if he or she could not have returned the ball, or accepts the interference and plays on, or the interference was so minimal that the player’s access to and strike at the ball was not affected.
			<br>
			10.4.3. The player is entitled to a stroke (i.e. wins the rally) if the opponent did not make every effort to avoid the interference, or if the player would have hit a winning return, or if the player would have struck the opponent with the ball going directly to the front wall.
			<br>
	
		<br><b>11. Lets</b><br>               
			
			11.1. A let is an undecided rally. The rally does not count and the server serves again from the same box.
			<br>
			11.2. In addition to lets allowed as indicated in the paragraphs above, lets can be allowed in other circumstances.
			<br>
			11.2.1. For example, a let may be allowed if the ball in play touches any article lying on the floor, or if the striker refrains from hitting the ball owing to a reasonable fear of injuring the opponent.
			<br>
			11.3. A let must be allowed if the receiver is not ready and does not attempt to return the service, or if the ball breaks during play.
			<br>
		

		<br><b>12. Continuity of Play</b><br>               
		
			12.1. Play is expected to be continuous in each game once a player has started serving.
			<br>
			12.2. There should be no delay between the end of one rally and the start of the next one.
			<br>

			<br>	


		<br><b>13. Bleeding, injury and illness</b><br>               
			
			13.1. If an injury occurs, which involves bleeding, the bleeding must cease before the player can continue.
			<br>
			13.2. A player is allowed a reasonable time to attend to a bleeding wound.
			<br>
			13.3. If the bleeding was caused solely by the opponent’s action, the injured player wins the match.
			<br>
			13.4. If the bleeding recurs no further delay is allowed, except that the player can concede a game, using the 90 second period between games to attend to the wound and stop the bleeding.
			<br>
			13.5. If unable to stop it, the player must concede the match.
			<br>
			13.6. For an injury not involving bleeding, it must be decided whether the injury was either caused by the opponent or self-inflicted or contributed to by both players.
			<br>
			13.7. If caused by the opponent, the injured player wins the match if any recovery time is needed.
			<br>
			13.8. If self-inflicted, the injured player is allowed 3 minutes to recover and must then play on, or concede a game using the 90-second rest period between 
			games to recover.
			<br>
			13.9. If contributed by both players, the injured player is allowed an hour to recover.
			<br>
			13.10. A player who is ill must play on or can take a rest period by conceding a game and using the 90-second interval to recover.
			<br>
			13.11. Cramps, feeling sick and breathlessness (including asthma) are considered illnesses.
			<br>
			13.12. If a player vomits on court, the opponent wins the match.
			<br>

		<br><b>14. Conduct on court</b><br>               
			
			14.1. Offensive, disruptive or intimidating behavior in squash is not acceptable.
			<br>
			14.1.1. Included in this category are: audible and visible obscenities, verbal and physical abuse, dissent, abuse of racket, court or ball, unnecessary physical contact, excessive racket swing, unfair warm-up, time-wasting, late back on court, deliberate or dangerous play or action and coaching (except between games).

						<br><b>6. Play</b><br>              
				
					6.1. Object of the game is to score goals. A goal is scored each time the offense completes a pass in the defense’s endzone. Each goal counts as 1. After each score play is initiated as described in the next rule (5-b). Each time a goal is scored, the teams switch directions of their attack.
					<br>
					6.2. A coin flip will determine who will receive in the first half. The opposing team receives in the second half. Play is initiated with both teams lining up on the front of their respective endzone line. The defense throws the disc to the offense. Players may not leave their respective endzones until the disc is released.
					<br>
					6.3. The disc may be advanced in any direction by completing a pass to a teammate. If a pass is not completed (e.g. out-of-bounds, drop, block, interception) possession reverts to the opposing team (turnover).
					<br>
					6.4. Players may not run with the disc.
					<br>
					6.5. The person in possession of the disc has ten seconds to throw it. The defender 
					guarding the thrower counts out the stall mark. If ten seconds is reached, the 
					offense turns over the disc. If the defensive team switches defenders, the count 
					must revert to ‘1.’ A defensive player must be within 5 feet of the throw to 
					initiate a stall count.
					<br>
					6.6. A player’s pivot foot is established with the first touching of the ground. Moving the pivot foot is a travel, causing a turnover.
					<br>
					6.7. Only one defensive player may guard a thrower at any time. There must be at least one disc’s diameter between the upper bodies of the thrower and the marker at all times.
					<br>
					6.8. Intentionally bobbling, tipping, guiding, etc. of the disc in order to advance the disc is illegal and is considered travelling.
					<br>
					6.9. If offensive and defensive players catch the disc simultaneously, the offense
					retains possession.
					<br>
					6.10. A player cannot score by running with the disc into the endzone after gaining possession of the disc. His/her first point of contact must be completely in the endzone. A player who runs the disc into the endzone must take it to the closest point outside of the endzone and continue play from there.
					<br>
					6.11. Handoffs and catching your own throw are not allowed.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>7. Out-of-Bounds</b><br>              
				
					7.1. Any area not on the playing field is considered out-of-bounds. The perimeter lines are considered out-of-bounds.
					<br>
					7.2. For a receiver to be considered in-bounds after gaining possession of the disc, the first point of contact with the ground must be completely in-bounds. Should the momentum of the player carry him/her out-of-bounds after making a catch and landing in-bounds, the player is considered in-bounds. The player carries the disc to the point where he/she went out-of-bounds and puts the disc into play from that point.
					<br>
					7.3. If a pass goes out-of-bounds, the opposing team gains possession of the disc where it left the field of play.
					<br>
					7.4. If a throw-off lands out of bounds the receiving team will put the disc into play at the nearest point on the playing field where the disc went out-of-bounds.
					<br>
					
					<br><b>8. Fouls</b><br>              
					8.1. Players are responsible for their own foul and line calls. If a dispute cannot be resolved, a coin flip will determine the call
					<br>
					8.2. When a player initiates contact on another player a foul occurs. When a foul disrupts possession, the play resumes as if the possession was retained.
					<br>					
					8.3. Picks and screens are prohibited.

					<br>
					3.8. Team records will be kept based on the total number of games won and lost (e.g. A team winning 2 and losing 1 game would have a record of 2 and 1. In order to qualify for “A” playoffs, a team will have to win 5 out of the 9 possible games played in a season.)
					<br>
					3.9. Playoff matches consist of the winning of two out of three games. The 55 minute time limit is not in effect for the playoffs. During semi-final and final playoffs, each team will be allowed one 30-second timeout per game. Unused time outs 
					cannot be carried over to the next game.
					<br>
